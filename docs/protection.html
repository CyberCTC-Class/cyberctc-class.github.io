    <h2>How do you stay safe</h2>
    <p>There are many ways for you to stay safe online, including using a strong and seperate password for your emails, Installing the latest software and app updates, using 2fa, using a password manager, Backing your data up, and using 3 random words to create your passwords.</p>

    <h2>Strong and Seperate Passwords</h2>
    <p>Using a strong and seperate password for your email is important, more so now then ever. If a malicious actor were to gain access to your email account, they can access your private information, send emails pretending to be you, and change all of your other accounts passwords. Using a strong password that is unique will help protect your email in the event that a malicious actor gains access to a less important account, as they will likely try the password that is assosiated with your account. Ideally you should use unique passwords for all of your online accounts.</p>

    <h2>Installing latest Security Updates</h2>
    <p>You should always make sure that your app's and devices have the latest security updates. If you get a prompt to update don't ignore it. Make sure your Phone, tablet, and/or PC is completly updated to keep you safe. Make sure to update your smart devices, like watches, Amazon Alexa's, doorbells, ect. If your phone or device no longer recieves security updates, then it is time to upgrade to a new one, as you are vunerable to attacks. You don't need the latest and greatest devices, one that is a generation or two old will work just fine.</p>
