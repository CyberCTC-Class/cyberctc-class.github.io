<h2>What is this website?</h2>

<p>This website was created by a student in the CTC Cyber Security program in order to help give information to parents and potential future students. This site is activly being created so it will be updated weekly until all the content is available on the website.</p>

<p class="information">This site is devided into multiple parts, with this as the "home page". It'll have a brief summery of every section, followed by a link to each section that goes into more details about the different aspects of the class.</p>

<h2>What is Cyber Security?</h2>
<img src="assets/security.jpg" alt="security image" height="300" width="500">
<p>Cyber security is a branch of Computer Science focusing on protecting personal and company data from unathorized sources. There are many aspects of Cyber Security, from passwords and encryption to defensive hacking and hardening your network to prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access to your network. The course at CTC shows you how to work on all of these aspects and more.</p>
<p> There are more aspects to Cyber Security, which is detailed in this page <a href="Cyber.html" title="Cyber Security">here</a></p>

<h2>Why is cyber security important?</h2>
<p>Cyber Security is important because wihout it, your data can be read by anyone on the internet. Thankfully, cyber security has exsisted for about as long as the internet itself, preventing unauthorized access to your data, ranging from user data in a game to financial and medical data in a hospital payment portal, to even social security numbers in banks and the federal governemt. However, there are some companies that fail to have the best cyber security practices, but even the companies that do can experiance hacks if something doesn't update or someone slipped and accidently left a authentication token vunerable. There is a list of recent hacks and other news in cyber security <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/" title="bleeping computer">at this website</a>, and a list of the bigger hacks in the last 2 years that has caused a great deal of other issues in the cyber security world <a href="news.html" title="cyber news">here</a></p>

<h2>How can you protect yourself?</h2>
<p>You can protect yourself from having your accounts being stolen by setting up a strong password or passphrase. I'd personally recomend using 10 characters with 1 number and 1 special character. A passphrase or a longer password is more secure, however they can be hard to remember, which is why getting a password manager is helpful. It will not only keep track of your passwords, some of the paid password managers offer a OTP(one time password) generator, which will allow you to protect your account more. Google authenticator will create OTP's for your accounts if you allow it to. Microsoft Authenticator not only offers OTP's for your microsoft account, it also allows for creation of OTP's for your other accounts, and acts as a free password manager. For more information on how to protect yourself online the best you can, <a href="protection.html" title="Protect your self">this page</a></p>

<h2>What you will learn</h2>
<p>Mr.Lumpkins Cyber Security class Goes over all the basics of IT, Networking, and Cyber Security. First years will learn how to install computer parts, solve hardware and sofware issues, and get started on networking. By the end of their first year students will have aquired their preformance based IT Fundimentals Pro certification and will have gotten started on their Networking or Server certification. In their second year students will learn more about networks and servers, including helping around the classroom repairing and upgrading networking equipment, gaining hands on experiance in setting up and managing a network. They will also gain their Networking certification, and potentially their Security certifications as well, if students work quickly and efficently enough. More information about the class and courses are available <a href="class.html" title="The class">here</a></p>

<h2>Meet the teacher</h2>
<img src="assets/Lumpkin.jpg" alt="Mr Lumpkin" height="800" width="500">
<p>Mr.Lumpkin has a large number of interests, including Marvel comics, Xbox gaming(the superior gaming system, of course), and DND. He has more interests and fun facts about himself, available <a href="Mrlumpkin.html" title="meet the teacher">here</a></p>

<h2>Extra Activities</h2>
<p>While the class is primarily about Cyber Security, we also do some side projects in this classroom, ranging from making cables to setting up an entire AI server in this classroom. Every week on Friday, Mr.Lumpkin has us work on our "Friday Hour Project", which is just about anything relating to It or CyberSecurity, teacher approval of course. Some students have worked on 3d printing, playing DND with an AI, and a Starwars meme server. While these projects are not related to Cyber Security, they do use IT skills to work. We also do a contest called SkillsUSA, and while it is completly optional it is encouraged for us to participate in the contest as it is a leadership contest and looks really good on a resume. More information about Friday Hour projects and SkillsUSA, please look at <a href="SideProject.html" title="Skills USA">This Link</a></p>

<h2>Internships</h2>
<p>Some lucky students who have earned Mr.Lumpkins trust will be able to go on internships, which will allow the students to gain real world experiance without having to try and find a job for them to gain the experiance that will help them later down the road. Most internships are unpaid, although there are some paid ones you can get if you are lucky. More information on the internships are available <a href="Internships.html" title="Intern(unpaid)">here</a></p>
