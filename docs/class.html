<h2>What is done in class?</h2>
<p>We have many different topics that we go over in class. It ranges from Google classroom documents to hands on networking and device configuration. This section of the website will cover what we do in class on a daily basis, and what a traditional sub plan is like for when Mr.Lumpkin is busy.</p>

<h2>Google Classroom Work</h2>
<p>We do alot of work in google classroom on a daily basis, mainly our bellringers, but there are some other assignments posted on there from time to time. Below is a list of all the google classroom assignments.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bell Ringers</li>
    <li>Sub work</li>
    <li>Classwork</li>
    <li>AMI Days</li>
    <li>Friday Hour</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bell Ringers</h4>
<p>The Bell Ringers are warm ups that Mr.Lumpkin assigns in the morning to help his students wake up and get ready for class. They are typically news articles that you will read, write a report on, and discuss with the class. There are occasions where your bell ringer is just playing chess.com, but it is mainly News Articles.</p>

<h4>Sub Work</h4>
<p>Mr.Lumpkin occasionally has to miss school to do other tasks, take care of his kids, he is sick, he has cyber security conventions, and he is a robotics team coach so he has to go to those contests. Mr.Lumpkin will have you do sub work on the days that he is gone. Most of the time it is TestOut, but sometimes he will post videos for you to watch and answer questions on said video. As long as you get the work done on time and respectfully there should be no issues.</p>

<h4>Classwork</h4>
<p>Classwork refers to anything that isn't Testout that Mr.Lumpkin posts in Google Classroom. This is typically quizes, class "documentary"(movie) reviews, and small extra assignments he posts. Theses can typically be done rather quickly, ranging from half a class period to about 2 days.</p>

<h4>AMI days</h4>
<p>CTC does AMI days for the first 5 snow days. You have to get up and get the assignment done before 10am(morning ctc) or 2 pm(afternoon ctc). This assignment is typically a news article or another assignment that can be done in under 5 minutes. If you do not get the assignment done before the due time and you have not emailed Lumpkin with a reason why you didn't do the assignment, ie you have no power or internet(emailed from phone), you are shovling snow for money, or another reason that he deems acceptible. You have to communicate or you <b>WILL BE COUNTED ABSCENT</b> and it will be <b>UNEXCUSED</b></p>
