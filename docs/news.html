<h2>Yahoo Data Breach of 2013-2014</h2>
<p>This is still concidered on of the biggest hacks in history, even over a decade later. The reason it still is one of the biggest hacks of all time is because, in 2013, a hacker group who is beleived to work for the Russian state, broke into Yahoo and stole ALL 3 billion Yahoo user account information, and it went undetected for 3 years. Another hack happened in 2014, which allowed the hackers to gain access to private information of another 500 million accounts. There has yet to be a hack that tops this spacific event in tech history.</p>
